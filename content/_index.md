# Hi, I'm Bryce! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Cloud Native Infrastructure Engineer** who discovered the power of code and automation to solve real-world infrastructure challenges.

## My Journey

- **Python Development** - From simple bash scripts to sophisticated automation tools
- **Ansible Automation** - Infrastructure as Code for managing OpenStack regions
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Hands-on with OpenStack, Ceph, and modern cloud platforms
- **Problem Solving** - Real solutions to complex infrastructure challenges

My career evolved from traditional IT support to cloud engineering, driven by the belief that **code can eliminate toil** and make infrastructure both more reliable and enjoyable to manage.

## What I Do

Currently working as an OpenStack Infrastructure Engineer, managing multiple regions with Kolla-Ansible and maintaining Ceph storage clusters. I write Python applications for infrastructure automation and use Ansible extensively for configuration management.

*From manual processes to Infrastructure as Code - that's my story.*
